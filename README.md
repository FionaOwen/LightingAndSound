The user's proximity to the church triggers both visual and auditory stimuli. The sound of the bells' is triggered and amplified. Additionally, the animations of the NPCs are triggered, including a greeting, 'Merry Christmas'. 

### Interactable Streetlight

The streetlight provides an opportunity for the user to interact with a push button, activating a real-time spotlight that was previously unlit.
